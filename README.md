#BRICOLAGE
A collage app exploring the Unsplash collection of beautiful photos. You can create your own photo wall from a search of the collection, minimize, maximize, and delete your photos, as well as view other users' photo walls. Sign-in is easy with OAuth via Twitter or a local login as well. Lots of back-end Mongo optimizations to reduce API calls and make things look nice and snappy for the end user. Still a bit of CSS tweaking and stylistic things to do, but this is the first version.
